# WaterlooWorks Alternative


looking for devs to help, please email me at \[first name] dot \[last name] at mail.mcgill.ca

also looking for social media managers, and people who want to deal with contacting external companies 



Project scope roadmap; 

1. Bot to scrape all canada / US internship + newgrad roles and store them into a data base
2. Twilio to phone / send text when a new internship is posted
3. website to let students sign up and add their resumes and work experience 
4. Process tracking and updates to students through email, plus time lines on the website
5. Catagory for job posts (adding more jobs like sales / fiance and country of job)
6. discord community to make process tracking easier 
7. Chrome extension to auto apply 
8. check resumne against resumes we have in database to help companies prevent cheating 
9. ML with reusmes we have in database to show users were to apply and when for the highst chance of success analystics on the process
10. Hopefully then we can organize online career events to help students get into CS. (resume prep channels / advice / guides applying guides leetcode guides etc)
11. form to find cofounders / project partners and to show off projects 

## Time line

By end of winter break core feautrues working (discord community, website with process tracking, scanning job forms, sending to student emails)


by end of winter semester (catagories, accepting resumes, guides, )


by end of summer (ML featuires, checking for cheating, carrer events, show off projects form (with checks for cheating) )

## Motivation: 

It seems that may students without coop oppertunities / programs / a strong CS culture in their school are lost when trying to apply for job, end up missing oppertunity and then falling behind. StudentWorks seek end to end the unfair advantage given by those programs by giving students all the information they need to have to apply. for example x internship takes a lot of first years, better use of your time to apply there, or Y doesn't like to hire from your university better to put time into Z. Other information about who got into X company so you can see the ammount of experience you need etc. Finally have a community that supports students through resume roasts etc to make sure everyone is on the grind, having a leetcode bot would be interesting too if we have the time. 

I just seek to help create talent. 


Target audience: 
First second third years looking to break into CS, most "try - hard" students will already know most that we have to offer.
